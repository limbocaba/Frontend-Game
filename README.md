# About This Project

The goal of this project was to create a functioning game using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The final product as of now is a scroller game with the theme of the cartton show Rick and Morty. You spawn in as Morty and the objective is to avoid all obstacles(the ship and portal) coming at you. The moment you make contact with one of them, the game ends.

# MVP and Future Updates

As of right now the game is at MVP, it functions properly and the collision mechanics are great. In future updates it will receive more obstacles as the game progresses, background music and perhaps even more levels!

# Post MVP Goals

- Add background music and sound effects
- Add more obstacles to the game as it progresses
- Add different levels where the background, scenery and obstacles are different(maybe even characters)
- Create a high score div
